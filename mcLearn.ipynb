A finely oaked finish holds root beer and dark-berry flavors that smoothly fade out. Drink through 2021.',\n",
              "        b'This ripe tropical-fruit style of Sauvignon Blanc is delicious. Its crisp side with some citrus is balanced by the apricot and ripe mango flavors that give the wine richness and fine perfumes. This is a food style of wine, ready to drink from 2018.',\n",
              "        b'This brings bracing minerality into the forefront, in a terroir-driven wine with excellent penetration and depth. A fresh mix of citrus and stone, this elevates Viognier into the top echelons of Washington white wines.',\n",

It has the tannic-acidic structure and dryness to make it refined, but explodes on the palate with blackberry, chocolate, cassis, anise and sweet, smoky cedar flavors that are deep and long. Tastes important and first rate.',\n",
              "        b\"Cascina del Monastero's base Barolo shows simple fruit tones and offers an easy, straight shooter approach overall. You'll get aromas of wild berry, cola and spice and the wine is firm and compact on the close. In all, it comes off as an informal interpretation of one of the world's greatest wines.\",\n",
              "        b'Subtle hints of ripe pineapple and peach hover over this delicate and very refreshing wine. Notes of lemon and citrus zest provide freshness and zing but the most remarkable aspect is its lightness. Dry, ultralight-bodied and super-refreshing this is a great choice for a summer party.',\n",
              "        b\"Flat aromas include iodine, butterscotch and cider, but overall the nose isn't that lively or fresh. The palate, meanwhile, is round, soft and mealy, with oaky, barrel-fermented flavors of buttered baked apple and resin. Proves why barrel-fermented Viura is sketchy terrain.\",\n",
              "        b\"The winery has a good track record with this bottling, which shows how well Petite Sirah does in the warmer St. Helena appellation of Napa Valley. This '08 is dryish to moderately sweet in jammy blackberries and blueberries, with a smoked meat, bacon edge. But it's also firmly tannic, which provides a framework for the sweetness.\",\n",
              "        b\"Sourced from vines planted in 1847, this is a full-bodied, open-knit wine, supple and velvety in texture.

              "        b'A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Limnio, this is a Bordeaux-like blend offering aromas of clove, mint and blueberry, and black fruit flavors. An elegant and integrated balance of fruit, wooded spice and acid gives the medium-bodied sip ageability. Paired with game or more complex red meat dishes, this blend is a classy alternative from an exotic locale.',\n",

              "        b'Normally grown in the D\\xc3\\xa3o region, this grape needs poor soil to flourish. On its own, it makes a powerfully fruity wine packed with red fruits and some flavors of dark chocolate. The acidity is intense, and needs another few months to settle down.',\n",
              "        b'Made with organically farmed grapes, this opens with earthy aromas of ripe black fruit and whiffs of barnyard. The rustic palate offers fleshy black cherry, crushed raspberry and gamey notes alongside rather fleeting tannins.',\n",

              "        b'This solid if standard Pinot Noir proffers raspberry, earthiness, herbs and a touch of leather on the nose. The palate comes on silky but winds up fairly tannic by the finish. Wait until 2015 and this will be a much better wine.',\n",
              "        b'Crafted from the oldest vines in one of the oldest vineyards in the Walla Walla Valley, this displays lovely aromatics of leaf, herb, earth and wild berry. Tight and contained, it opens into a focused, lively wine with great acidity. It has the potential to age well for a decade or more.',\n",
              "        b'Alluring scents of Spanish broom, iris, berry and a hint of dried herb come together on this. The bright palate offers candied cherry, nectarine zest, white pepper and a hint of fennel while a mineral note signals the finish.',\n",
              "        b'Earthy red-berry aromas include a note of forest floor. A medium-bodied palate is centered on tight racy acidity, while this blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon tastes of red plum, mixed spices and cocoa powder. An edgy finish with spiced cherry and plum flavors is juicy and primed by raw acidity.',\n",
              "        b'Aromas of red and black berries, tilled earth, leather and balsamic notes characterize this structured, single-vineyard bottling.

Shows the classic balance and elegance of a fine red wine, with smooth tannins framing the variety's wildly exotic flavors of blackberries, blueberries, bacon, tobacco, grilled mushrooms, tamari, anise and lots of black pepper. Great now with BBQ, and should evolve in interesting ways for many years.\",\n",
              "        b\"A pristine core of blackberry and cherry extend from nose to palate here, but there's an ample dose of spice, coconut and toast as well. Full bodied and supple in texture, it's a robust wine with an accessible fruity style.\",\n",
              "        b'This wine is electric pink in color, with notes of strawberry bubblegum and cranberry. It drinks off dry, with watermelon and red fruit flavors that linger on the finish.',\n",

              "        b'This is initially dark and earthy, with brandied cherry, leather and tobacco aromas. It feels complete and offers core acids to keep it feeling fresh. Flavors of black fruit and spice lead to a lasting finish with cola and cherry notes.',\n",

The sample this note is based on was weighty and smooth, with apple and floral notes and then an almosty buttery palate with baked apple and citrus flavors.

              "        b'A rather neutral but fresh nose leads onto a palate where freshness, texture and alcoholic warmth unite into a punchy, fluid and substantial body.

              "        b\"Veteran chef Puck lends his name here to a quaffable wine. It's a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and several other varieties. The mouthfeel is soft with luscious flavors veering toward cherry pie. A portion of the profits goes to Alzheimer's research.\",\n",
              "        b\"There's a streak of citrus running down the spine. The lively acidity adds some zip to the blackberry and black cherry fruit.

              "        b'An aromatic hint of quince dances over the various zesty citrus flavors on this slender, crisp and light yet expressive Riesling.

              "        b'The nose on this secret blend is clean and tight, not showy at all, with just a touch of papaya and honey. It expands greatly on the palate with banana and melon, but wipes up quick with a fresh burst of acidity.',\n",

              "        b'Elderberry and black currant fruit mesh with cedar, smoked beef and pencil lead on the nose of this impressive bottling of a rarely solo grape.

              "        b'Tight purple fruit smells of black raspberry meet with violets, crushed slate, dried rose petals, raw beef and black peppercorns on the focused nose. The palate is very slate-driven and rocky, offering turned earth, juniper and more dark raspberry flavors. It is still very tightly wound, and needs more time to unfurl.',\n",

Rich and full in the mouth, it also has a range of complex fruit flavors followed by hints of toastiness that will only continue to develop. It should be aged further, so drink from 2016.',\n",
              "        b\"Solid as can be, with sweet-styled aromas of berry syrup and tire rubber. In the mouth, the wine shows juicy cherry and raspberry flavors in front of a lively finish.

The color off this wine is on the light side, and so are the raspberry, tea leaf and cinnamon flavors, but they make for a pleasant, harmonious combination. Medium body, vibrant acidity and firm but light tannins add to its appetizing character.\",\n",

Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer says the Syrah grapes barely ripen and that's why he likes them for this wine. Light at 12.8% alcohol, it's an intriguing melange of earthy dark strawberry and mint, crisp in acidity.\",\n",

              "        b'So smooth, this is a rich, grandiose wine. Although it is full of black currant fruits and spice flavors, the texture is most impressive. Dusty tannins are integrated with juicy fruits seamlessly. The purest fruit flavors are allied to linear tannins in a precise yet generous way. The wine is evolving beautifully, but do not drink before 2020.',\n",
              "        b'Tart red cherry and fresh herb lend a crisp, cool tone to this elegantly composed Syrah. The palate is plush and concentrated in red plum and cherry flavors that are balanced by bristling cranberry acidity. Velvet tannins cap the finish.',\n",

              "        b'What a pretty wine. Made for drinking soon, it shows impeccable balance in the finely ground tannins, moderate alcohol and deft touch of oak. Feels soft and complex in the mouth, carrying flavors of berries, herbs, mocha and sandalwood. Easy to find, with 16,056 cases produced.',\n",
              "        b\"Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy. Finishes with heft, length and weight, which all seems a little overbearing given the wine's simplicity. Just good enough but doesn't fully click.\",\n",
              "        b'A rich, viscous combination of 55% Roussanne, 35% Grenache Blanc and 10% Viognier, this offers a bite of creamy vanilla amidst layered, hearty and concentrated flavors of lemon chiffon. Fermented in oak and stainless steel, it aged for 11 months in French oak, only 28% of it new.',\n",
              "        b'Black currant, bell pepper and leather aromas lead the way on this blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. The dense palate delivers ripe black cherry, grilled pepper, mocha and cracked black pepper alongside bracing tannins.',\n",

              "        b\"This is a tough wine in two ways. It's rather hard and brittle in acids and tannins now, and it's also tough to predict its future. It's rich in currant, blackberry jam, coffee and cedar flavors, but there is an undertow of raisins that could compromise its longterm viability.\",\n",
              "        b'Usually this block is at the top of the offerings from Coeur de Terre, but a leathery aroma and dried-out fruit knock it down in this vintage.

              "        b'A touch of flinty funk hovers on the nose. The palate at first unfurls in a grapefruity zesty texture on which riper notions of pear and peach, quince and smoke are displayed. The merest touch of residual sweetness lends a baroque sheen to this tableau, always countered by spicy zesty freshness while being so seductive. The dry whistle-clean finish still tingles with that aromatic fruit of the concentrated midpalate. A great expression of the great 2015 vintage: rich but streamlined, seductive but contained and therefore all the more intriguing. Drink now through 2035.',\n",

              "        b'A wonderful Riesling, so polished and pretty. It was grown on the cooler western side of the Santa Lucia Mountains, where the chilly climate has kept refreshing acidity while letting the grapes fully ripen.

              "        b\"This is a very approachable and tasty wine, especially for a grape that can be so tannic when young. Aromas of cola, chopped mint and cherries translate to a fruity and minty palate, with just enough tannins, a nice acidic spice and a bit of woodiness on the finish. It's very well measured.\",\n",

              "        b\"Made with Negroamaro, this zesty ros\\xc3\\xa9 opens with aromas of red berry and Mediterranean brush. It's bright and juicy, with Marasca cherry, raspberry and hint of crushed aromatic herb flavors.\",\n",
              "        b'While the texture is light, the fruit and the wood flavors give this wine richness and a ripe, toast and apricot character. It has balanced acidity that allows a fresher edge to develop. The aftertaste, hinting at a steely edge, suggests the wine will age. Drink from 2017.',\n",

The tar shows strongly on the palate, as do blackberry blossoms and denser black pepper spice.',\n",
              "        b\"Despite the late harvest label, this is not a dessert wine. It's been fermented to near-dryness, and the late-picked fruit has resulted in quite high alcohol. It's an odd duck, but tasty with an appealing lemon-drop candy flavor.\",\n",

Grown in northeastern Greece on an ancient site overlooking the Aegean Sea, this is smooth and velvety with rich, spicy flavors and a lingering finish. Its texture and complexity lends it to pairings with more opulent dishes like rack of lamb and beef stew, but alternately, consider its Mediterranean roots and sip alongside a plate of spicy black olives or a Greek salad.',\n",
              "        b'A blend of equal parts of Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese, this opens with mature blackberry, cedar and underbrush aromas.

As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak.

This gorgeous evocation of Russian River Chardonnay is flashy and delicious now, but the window of opportunity seems to be between 2014\\xe2\\x80\\x932017 before the fruit starts to fade away.',\n",

It's crusty and dark on the nose, with magnanimous baked-fruit, earth and berry aromas. The feel is just right and the wine shows few, if any, faults or breaks. Overall it's pure and fades away with rich, dark flavors and velvety tannins. A New World red wine that's sure to please. 350 cases made.\",\n",

A touch of burnt brown sugar offers balance and sweetness, and as a whole it seems ready to drink.\",\n",

              "        b'The vintage was a good one for Sequum, which is assembling an impressive track record. The wine is dry and tannic, yet wonderfully forward in blackberries and black currants, and the oak application is perfect. Give it until 2020 or so in the cellar.',\n",
              "        b\"This brings a lively mix of green citrus and green banana, with a light streak of white peach. All in all, it's balanced and fresh, though it falls on the lighter side, despite the generous finished alcohol.\",\n",
              "        b'Combining rich cinnamon and clove aromas with ripe blackberry and nutmeg flavors and very firm tannins, this is a full-throttle red. A sense of concentration and focus marks the fruit notes, and all is framed by astringency that cleanses the palate. It will be best after 2016.',\n",
              "        b'This wine is rich while also crisp. Refreshing red fruits are laced with a touch of orange peel and spice. A blend of the local Nieullucciu and Sciaccarellu, it is fruity and very ready to drink.',\n",
              "        b\"This Barbera d'Alba from the 2006 vintage exhibits a slightly brownish, aged color with aromas of candied fruit, dried plums and prunes. There are gritty, thick tannins with flavors of smoked ham or beef jerky on the close.\",\n",
              "        b\"A steal for its price, this wine is refreshingly quaffable, with a sublimely textured palate of preserved lemon and nectarine. It's both lush and surprisingly complex.\",\n",
              "        b\"Structure, minerals and lees mark this elegant Chardonnay. You'll find ripe pear and tropical fruits that taste like they were baked into a pie, but ripe fruit is easy to achieve these days. It's the architectural integrity that makes this wine so fine.\",\n",
              "        b'This soft, ripe wine is a blend of 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon. With black-currant fruit and bright acidity, the wine is fruity and ready to drink.',\n",
              "        b'Red-cheeked apples, juicy pear and Mirabelle plums comes out to play here, tightly held by brilliant acidity. The undertone of herbal savoriness is glimpsed and will come to the fore as this ages. Drink as of 2016.',\n",
              "        b\"A fine companion to the winery's Lumi\\xc3\\xa8re Chardonnay, this takes the grape in a much different direction. Here old vine grapes fall under the influence of barrel fermentation with wild yeast. Aged in 40% new French oak, and (presumably) put through malolactic fermentation, it's a buttery bonbon of a wine, tasting of brioche and baked apples, with a silky smooth finish.\",\n",
              "        b'The nose of this lively white is a combination of delicate aromas of wildflower and orchard fruit while the bright palate offers tart Granny Smith apple, tangerine and a hint of crushed stone. Vibrant acidity carries through to the crisp finish.',\n",
              "        b'This robust red shows plenty of ripe berry flavors, firm texture and full body. It has a gripping mouthfeel and persistent raspberry and cranberry flavors that make the mouth water.',\n",
              "        b'This offers aromas of red berry, leafy underbrush and a whiff of chopped mint. The juicy palate delivers succulent black cherry, orange zest and ground pepper alongside sleek tannins.',\n",
              "        b'Blended with 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this mountain-grown wine offers bold black plum and berry around a compacted, extracted fullness of tannin and French oak. Dried herb, clove and vanilla accent the fruit, while the finish lingers gingerly.',\n",
              "        b\"Simple, delicate and fruity, a jammy style with sweetly ripe flavors of wild raspberries and strawberries, as well as espresso, tobacco and Oriental spices. It's light and silky on the palate.\",\n",
              "        b'Cedar, cigar box and earth notes blend with ripe berry aromas to give a subtle, charming bouquet. Rich and full-bodied, with roasted berry, chocolate and coffee flavors. Finishes dark and sweet, with chunky ripeness all the way to the end. Drink now through 2013.',\n",
              "        b'Aromas of roasted and green coffee beans lead to plush fruit and barrel flavors. It shows a fine sense of balance.',\n",
              "        b'Petit Verdot (38%) takes the lead on this blend, followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (26%), Merlot (12%), Cabernet Franc (12%) and Malbec. The aromas come off as leafy and green, with notes of dates, flowers and spice. The palate is quite light and elegant, not having the heft to stand on its own. The extraction seems dialed way back.',\n",
              "        b\"It's hard to believe such a wine can come from the Barossa, a region known for size and richness. But this is part of a new wave of Aussie Shiraz\\xe2\\x80\\x94medium in body and silky in style, with moderate alcohol levels. Healthy doses of oak impart notes of hickory smoke, cedar and vanilla to the plum fruit. Drink now\\xe2\\x80\\x932025.\",\n",
              "        b\"The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit. It's concentrated and deep, with appealing purity of flavor and the structure to age for over a decade.\",\n",
              "        b\"A chunky, deep-fruited Malbec that is all about blackberry fruit. There's no funk or odd, floral, overcropped aromas here; instead, it's focused on roasted blackberry flavors, a natural herbal character, and coffee and mocha on the finish. Emphasizes size and friendliness.\",\n",
              "        b'A nice wine, good and dry. It has forward peach, pineapple, apricot and oaky vanilla and caramel flavors, and a finely acidic finish.',\n",
              "        b\"Here's a good, useful Cabernet with some real elegance. It's bone dry and sturdy in tannins, with solid blackberry and currant flavors leading to a long, sweet finish. Drink over the next three years.\",\n",
              "        b\"It's always a treat to discover a good, well-made but not overpowering wine. This one has nothing in excess, just moderate and crisp fruit flavors with light spicy accents. An appetizing texture backed by good acidity leads to a clean, dry finish. This unoaked wine from northern California should be a crowd pleaser.\",\n",
              "        b'This opens with aromas of mature orchard fruit, lemon zest and acacia honey. The vibrant palate delivers candied grapefruit, Golden Delicious apple and vanilla alongside fresh acidity that leaves a clean finish. Enjoy soon.',\n",
              "        b'This wine starts with a soft, harmonious nose of cherry, cinnamon and pepper, and the flavors, though a touch tart and thin, offer a good spicy midpalate and elegant overall character.',\n",
              "        b\"It's rare to find a Washington Malbec at this price; and this is a very good one at that. Toasty and firm upon entry, it loads the palate with black cherry and cassis, followed with generous barrel flavors of coffee and a finishing thread of smoke. It tastes like a wine that was intended to sell for considerably more.\",\n",
              "        b\"This bright and engaging wine looks quite deep in color, smells jammy, tastes fresh, young and gushing with ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors. It's not too tannic, not too full-bodied, appropriately dry and easy to enjoy.\",\n",
              "        b'Lonesome Spring and Clifton fruit goes into this Grenache, which includes 16% Syrah and 8% Mourv\\xc3\\xa8dre. Very spicy and pretty aromas invite sipping; the white pepper stands out, along with tart raspberry/cranberry fruit. The wine feels just a little bit chalky in the mouth, but that actually sets it up well for simple smoked or grilled meats.',\n",
              "        b\"Smells oakier and fruitier than the regular bottling, with pretty peach and green-apple notes. There's a fair amount of richness on the palate. The fruit is spicy and ripe, and the oak adds spice and a sappy sweetness. Very balanced and likable, and certainly a nice food wine.\",\n",
              "        b'Ah, this wine is distinctive and practically haunting in personality, as wild, earthy, sage and mushroom aromas meet meaty, savory, mineral-like flavors on a well-balanced frame of good acidity and appetizing, fine-grained tannins.',\n",
              "        b'This is a light, compact Roero Riserva (made with Nebbiolo grapes) that shows drying tannins and sharp aromas of wild berry, citrus zest and white almond.',\n",
              "        b\"It's the 100% Merlot that gives the alcohol and superripe fruit to this wine, redeemed by the acidity. Licorice and dark chocolate flavors go with the sweetest plums and spice. Age for 3\\xe2\\x80\\x934 years.\",\n",
              "        b\"Aromas of ripe nectarines entice on the nose of this clean, crisp, medium-bodied Chardonnay. While initially quite soft, there's a tartness towards the midpalate that reflects hints of underripe stone fruit and quince.\",\n",
              "        b'Honeyed graham cracker, shrimp consomm\\xc3\\xa9 and wet stone notes make for an idiosyncratic nose. Delicate flavors of citrus, pear and mineral add interest to the palate, and the lively acidity provides a pleasing cut. Pair this with shucked oysters or grilled clams.',\n",
              "        b'Dry, earthy plum, cherry, tomato and leather aromas are fresh but also a touch hard and harsh. This cement-egg-fermented Cab Franc features a medium body and cutting acidity. Raw red-plum and red-berry flavors finish tight, crisp and short. Drink this juicy, monoline red through 2020.',\n",
              "        b'Aromas of oak, chocolate, nutmeg and spiced plum lead the nose of this robust wine. The ripe palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice, tobacco and baking spice alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.',\n",
              "        b\"Looking for something different to serve with your cheese course? This aged white might be just the thing. Scents of grape skins and honey waft from the glass, followed by flavors akin to honey, beeswax and bitter almond. It tastes like there's a hint of residual sugar as well.\",\n",
              "        b'Aromas of ripe black plum, cooking spice and scorched earth lead the nose. The robust, bulky palate offers prune, dried cherry, vanilla and a hint of white pepper set against bracing tannins while the heat of scorching alcohol throws it off balance. Drink soon to catch the remaining fruit.',\n",
              "        b\"Rich and ripe in juicy blackberries, currants and cedar, with thick tannins. But there's a sharp acidity that kicks in immediately and detracts from the mouthfeel. Drink now.\",\n",
              "        b\"Awesomely rich in fruit as well as oak, this wine is almost too much of a good thing. But there's plenty of acidity for balance, and enough minerallity and earthiness to ground the massive cherry, raspberry and strawberry flavors. Delicious now, and should evolve well over the next five years.\",\n",
              "        b'This caramel-flavored, lightly pink wine is soft and full in the mouth, with a light touch of tannin in the background. Drink now.',\n",
              "        b'This bright-colored, quite fruity wine has strong berry and cherry flavors, rich-feeling bubbles and a slightly sweet finish.',\n",
              "        b\"This bears apple and pear flavors that are set amidst buttery, toasty accents. It's smooth and easy to drink, and the mouthfeel has a certain oiliness.\",\n",
              "        b'A somewhat reserved wine but one that still shows some complexity with notes of honey, apricot, lychee and smoky spice. The palate is rich and luscious with good length and a spice-filled finish.',\n",
              "        b'A well-balanced mix of highlights: dried herbs, dusty cherry fruit, and a streak of citrus come together in this estate-grown wine. It finishes with a lick of caramel, from aging in 22% new oak.',\n",
              "        b'Roasted and earthy smelling, with a pinch of iodine and even a whiff of bacon or ham. Rich, full and a touch sticky on the tongue, with baked berry and chocolate flavors. Mellow and sweet on the back end. 100% Malbec.',\n",
              "        b'This blend of 70% Montepulciano and 30% Sangiovese opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush and ripe black fruit. Ripe black cherry and raspberry flavors are layered with chocolate and espresso, alongside rough, drying tannins.',\n",
              "        b'Dark and full-bodied in style and taste, this savory wine offers leathery tannins and value for the quality. Wild berries rise to the fore on the nose and palate, with a floral rejoinder and herbal, woodsy notes.',\n",
              "        b'This late release sourced from several vineyards dating back to the 1970s and 1980s is thin on the palate, with tart plum, herb, orange peel and of pineapple hints. Low alcohol reflects the cool vintage.',\n",
              "        b\"Good depth and a sense of complexity are this wine's strong points. It layers red cherry, black cherry and a moderate dose of spicy oak through the aromas and flavors, and has a nice harmony of different elements, plus firm acidity and tannins to give the texture a little bite.\",\n",
              "        b\"Salad dressing, vinegar and a heavy herbal blast greet you on the nose. The palate is chunky and thick in feel, but the flavors mirror the nose with green notes, herbs and burnt coffee. Has its merits but there's no escaping the fact that this is an herbal, roasted red blend.\",\n",
              "        b'This is a fruity, perfumed wine with just enough structure to keep it all together. Fresh and with red fruit flavors, it is already drinkable.',\n",
              "        b'With its strawberry flavor and tight acidity, this is an attractive, clean sparkling wine. It has just the right balance between acidity and bright fruit, leaving a textured aftertaste.',\n",
              "        b'Hits the fat and the lean of Sauvignon Blanc with both fig and grassy flavors. A well-balanced wine, it shows a smooth mouthfeel and a long finish. This is one to have with grilled fish.',\n",
              "        b'Attractive fragrances of mulled berries, cassis and black cherry lead the fruity bouquet of this wine, with added interest from supporting notes of sweet smoke, pepper and licorice root. The mouthfeel is creamy and full, but with ample tannin and acidity to provide structure and lend a gripping texture. Ripe flavors of plum, fig, cassis, black tea and leather flood the palate and linger long on the finish. Drink now\\xe2\\x80\\x932018.',\n",
              "        b'Pear and peach aromas lead the nose while the brisk palate offers lemon, lime, grapefruit and a mineral note. Zesty acidity and vigorous, persistent bubbles provide the racy framework.',\n",
              "        b\"This easy Poggio Stella Merlot is redolent of black cherry, mature raspberry and currants. It's aged in oak casks for six months to add a playful touch of spice and toast. Pair this well-priced Italian wine with grilled sausage or meatloaf.\",\n",
              "        b'Produced from vines up to 80 years old, this is a powerful, wood-aged wine. Tannins are mixed with toast, spice and dark plum flavors. Acidity gives freshness and finishes the wine with very fine fruits as well as structure. Age this impressive wine and drink from 2018.',\n",
              "        b'Rubbery and roasted, but not too much so. Otherwise one should look for medicinal berry aromas followed by flavors of baked plum, prune and black pepper. The finish is dense, a touch flat, and chocolaty; overall this is a chunky, sweet performer.',\n",
              "        b'This fresh, young wine, showcases a palate-thrilling mix of ripe tree fruits\\xe2\\x80\\x94sappy apples, juicy citrus\\xe2\\x80\\x94and some hints of pineapple as well. The ripeness turns the lemony fruit into limoncello, and the finish is long and wonderfully refreshing.',\n",
              "        b'Oaky aromas like cedar and maple syrup continue into the flavors, meeting jammy strawberry and black cherry. The texture is smooth but firmly tannic, and the finish conveys a touch of sweetness.',\n",
              "        b'Very stylish, but substantial too, with engaging lemon, vanilla, earth and toast aromas. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taut and crisp on the palate, where lovely green-apple, lemon and spice flavors shine. A persistent bead, and familiar flavors with an interesting mineral streak play out on the bright finish. Delicious now and will keep well.',\n",
              "        b\"Vigna Mandorlo ushers forth sweet-smelling aromas of Christmas spice, nutmeg, ginger and vanilla backed by chopped herbs, anise, licorice and underbrush. There's a layer of smoky mesquite that also appears on the finish. This bright Barolo has a vibrant, sharp feel in the mouth and ends with dusty tannins. Very nice.\",\n",
              "        b\"This wine is a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Malbec. It shows the big, hard tannins of both varieties, as well as their dryness and intense blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. The 100% new French oak is in balance with the size of the underlying fruit. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015, and it should still be providing pleasure in 2021.\",\n",
              "        b'This is a ripe wine, maybe no longer a fresh Muscadet, but certainly a rich one. It has kept some fruitiness while gaining a smooth and creamy character along with intense acidity. It is ready to drink now.',\n",
              "        b'This aromatic wine has floral, grapefruity aromas, generous citrus flavors, light body, a dry profile and a slightly soft, smooth texture.',\n",
              "        b\"You'd swear this 100% varietal wine had some Viognier in it, but the orange-peel aromas and flavors are just a hallmark of Yakima Valley fruit. It also features abundant cranberry, mulberry, rose hip and savory notes. The supple feel with light meat accents is where this wine really shines, showing purity, texture and a lot of elegance. Those looking for big fruit, look elsewhere.\",\n",
              "        b'A small-production offering from the grower-producer, this is a restrained take on the variety, lightly bodied and ripened, with juicy acidity at its core. Cherry, earth and a tension of dried herb complement each other on the palate, before a lengthy finish of white pepper draped in violets closes things out.',\n",
              "        b'A beautifully rich and rewarding expression of tropical fruit and creamy texture, this estate white spends nine months in large French oak casks and is selected from the best lots. Supporting acidity keeps it refreshing in waves of lime and grapefruit.',\n",
              "        b'Smoke, yeast, earth and peppery herbs unite to make an almost archetypal Gr\\xc3\\xbcner. The palate has the same savory core but also introduces green and yellow pear to create a very harmonious, textured palate that just sings with spice and pepper.',\n",
              "        b\"Hints of almond and lemon rind lend complexity to sweet honeydew and white peach flavors in this featherlight Riesling. Lacy sweetness coats the midpalate, offsetting streaks of tart lemon-lime and grapefruit. It's a pristine wine best enjoyed young for its refreshing, quaffable style.\",\n",
              "        b'This is a fresh, tonic and light Grillo that would pair with endive salad and sliced oranges or red beets in vinaigrette. The wine offers citrus, green herb and fresh kiwi aromas.'],\n",
